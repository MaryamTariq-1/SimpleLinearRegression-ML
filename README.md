# SimpleLinearRegression-ML

### Simple Linear Regression - Tips Dataset

This repository contains the Simple Linear Regression analysis of the "Tips" dataset. The aim of this project is to model the relationship between the total bill and the tip amount, and evaluate the performance of the regression model.

## Project Overview

The project involves:
- Understanding and cleaning the dataset
- Visualizing the data
- Building and training a simple linear regression model
- Evaluating the model's performance
- Experimenting with transformations and multiple features

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Tips" dataset from the seaborn library. The data includes details such as the total bill, tip amount, day, time, and other relevant information.

## File Structure

- `SimpleLinearRegression.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook for performing EDA and training the model.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MaryamTariq-1/Simple_Linear_Regression_Project.git
   
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the analysis script:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook SimpleLinearRegression.ipynb
    ```


1. **Data Loading and Cleaning:**
   - Load the dataset and inspect the first few rows.
   - Display summary statistics and check for missing values.

2. **Data Visualization:**
   - Visualize the relationship between the total bill and tip using scatter plots.
   - Create pair plots, histograms, and box plots to explore the data.
   - Generate a correlation heatmap to understand feature relationships.

3. **Model Building:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train a simple linear regression model using scikit-learn.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
   - Compare the predicted values with the actual values to assess accuracy.

5. **Experimentation:**
   - Experiment with log transformations and multiple features to improve model fit.
   - Train and evaluate models using the transformed and additional features.

## Results

The analysis provides insights into the relationship between the total bill and tip amount. Visualizations and model evaluations help in understanding the effectiveness of the simple linear regression model.
